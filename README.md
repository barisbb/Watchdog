# Watchdog

In this project, a simple program is created in C/C + + that implements
a watchdog system. The project consists of two parts; process definition and process control.
The process definition part specifies the process-specific information such as process id, process
name, and signals to be handled by each process. The process control part creates processes
and tries to keep these processes alive so that the system continues to run smoothly.
